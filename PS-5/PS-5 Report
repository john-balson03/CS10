I hard-coded the example graph into a POSTagger object for my initial tests and tested my viterbiDecode method on the
sentence "will eats the fish," for which it returned the correct parts of speech.

I tested my train method on the example files and the resulting maps for vertices and edges were the same as in the example.

I also tested my code on the brown data sets, although my computer could not run lines longer than 6 words (I am not
sure if that is a hardware problem or inefficiency in my code, although my code follows the pseudocode for the viterbi
algorithm closely). While I could not use my FileTagTester on the larger data sets, I used it on the simple data and got
26/32 correct. This seems reasonable, since the training data is relatively small. (I only had 32 observations since
I erased all punctuation)
